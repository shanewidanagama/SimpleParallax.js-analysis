  <h1>simpleParallax JS Library Tutorial</h1>  <!-- page header -->

<!-- Introduction -->
<section>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>simpleParallax.js is a javascript library that
  is used to apply basic parallax animations to image tags as a user scrolls
  through a webpage. It requires a single line of code to install, and a minimum
  of three more to implement its effect. For this reason, it is useful when the user needs to apply a simple
  parallax animation quickly and easily, provided that the web developer is not
  trying to make anything fancy (other parallax libraries can achieve more complex
  scrolling animations in fewer lines of code). The library's simplicity, also makes more accessible
  to web developers of varying skill, as well as people who are not web developers. Furthermore, the lightweight nature of
  simpleParallax.js means it is better suited for websites requiring fewer and
  less complex animation, as it will result in less of a performance hit than
  more complex parallax and scrolling javascript libraries. This library was
  made by Geoffrey Signorato. </p>

<!-- Pros and Cons of using simpleParallax.js -->
<section>
  <h2>Pros and Cons</h2>
  <p>This parallax library can be used to on image tags themselves, instead of having to set
  the desired images as background images. As such, it is intuitive and easy to use.
  It provides a smooth parallax effect while being very
  lightweight. A con of this library is the library's scrolling event can
  sometimes affect overall performance of the website. For this reason,
  the library's creator recommends using the requestAnimationFrame function of
  the Window interface. There are also a few quirks to take note of when using
  this library. Sometimes, for seemingly the parallax effect will not work.
  Changing the zoom level of the browser window will unfreeze the images, but
  it remains an unresolved issue web developers should know about. In addition,
  if there happens to be a syntax error in at least one of the javascript
  statements, all parallax effects on that page will cease to work. While this
  is not a problem for the end-user web developers should keep this in mind
  when writing or debugging their code.</p>

<!-- Overview of how to setup and use the library -->
<section>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <p>Here is some sample code that contains the bare minimum of what is needed
  to start using this parallax library. It installs the simpleParallax.js
  library, specifies and selects an image, and applies the default parallax
  effect to it.</p>

<!-- Explains various settings of the library, together with sample code and
output -->
<section>
  <h2>Settings</h2>
  <h4>Orientation</h4>
  <p>To change the direction of the parallax effect, set its orientation to at
  least one of four directions (up, down, right, left). Combinations of vertical
  and horizontal orientations can be used to create horizontal parallax effects.</p>
  <textarea rows="2" cols="80">
    i.e. let orientationImg = document.getElementsByClassName("orientationExample");
         new simpleParallax(orientationImg, {orientation: 'right'});
  </textarea>
  <div>
    <img class="orientationExample" src="./img/vaporwave.jpg" alt="vaporwave">
  </div>

  <h4>Scale</h4>
  <p>Increasing parallax effects scale will increase how much the image will
  move as the user is scrolling. However, this will also reduce the quality of
  the image. To prevent this, choose an image with a width (in pixels) that is equal to the
  current image width multiplied by the scale value. If the parallax effect is
  horizontal, replace width with length.</p>
  <textarea rows="2" cols="80">
    i.e. let scaleImg = document.getElementsByClassName('scaleExample');
         new simpleParallax(scaleImg, {scale: 2});
  </textarea>
  <div>
    <img class="scaleExample" src="./img/vaporwave.jpg" alt="vaporwave">
  </div>

  <h4>Overflow</h4>
  <p>By setting overflow to true, the selected image is able to continue beyond the
  length or width of an image, causing the image travel across the page. Be
  careful with this setting, as it result in the image overlapping with other
  areas of the webpage</p>
  <textarea rows="2" cols="80">
  i.e.  let overflowImg = document.getElementsByClassName("overflowExample");
        new simpleParallax(overflowImg, {overflow: true, orientation: 'right'});
  </textarea>
  <div>
    <img class="overflowExample" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/2814_-_Birth_of_a_new_day.jpeg" alt="vaporwave city">
  </div>

  <h4>Delay</h4>
  <p>The delay setting allows the parallax effect to continue for a time
  after the user has stopped scrolling. The delay time is measured in seconds.</p>
  <textarea rows="2" cols="80">
  i.e.  let delayImg = document.getElementsByClassName("delayExample");
        new simpleParallax(delayImg, {delay: 5});
  </textarea>
  <div>
    <img class="delayExample" src="./img/vaporwave.jpg" alt="vaporwave">
  </div>

  <h4>Additional Settings</h4>
  <h4>Transition</h4>
  <p>The transition setting is used to add any kind of CSS transition to the delay setting. This
  includes ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, and cubic-bezier. It
  accepts a string (i.e. linear), and is meant to be used together with the
  delay setting</p>
  <h4>Custom Container</h4>
  <p>The parallax effect is usually determined by the percentage that a user
  has scrolled in reference to the body. However, if an image is inside a
  container that the user can also scroll through, the customContainer setting
  can be used. customContainer can accept either a string or a node specifying
  the container that the scroll percentage should be calculated in reference to.
  </p>
  <h4>Max Transition</h4>
  <p>The maxTransition setting can be used to stop the parallax effect after
  reaching a particular scroll percentage ranging from 0% to 100%. As such,
  maxTransition accepts numbers (the % sign is not needed). </p>

  <h2>Methods</h2>
  <h3>Destroy simpleParallax instance</h3>
  <p>This straight forward method can be used to remove the parallax effect on
  an image for whatever reason.</p>

  <textarea rows="3" cols="80">
    i.e.  let delayImg = document.getElementsByClassName("delayExample");
          let instance = new simpleParallax(delayImg, {delay: 5});
          instance.destroy();
